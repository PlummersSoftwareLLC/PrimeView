# PrimeView

This is a Blazor WebAssembly static in-browser web application to view benchmark reports generated in/for the [Primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes) project.

At the moment, the application loads benchmark reports in JSON format, either from a configured location or using a default approach. More information on how this works can be found in [JsonFileReader/README.md](src/JsonFileReader/README.md).

The supported JSON format is the one generated by the benchmark tool in the Primes repository, when the FORMATTER=json variable is used, with one optional extension: in the metadata object, a string `"user"` property can be added to indicate the user who generated the report.

As the report reader back-end is isolated from the front-end (and added via dependency injection), it will be easy to replace it with a client for a different report provider, like a (REST) API that publishes benchmark reports, once that's available.

## Building

The solution can be built by running the following command from the repository root directory, once [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) is installed:

```
dotnet publish
```

At the end of the build process, the location of the build output will be indicated in the following line:
```
Frontend -> <repo root>\src\Frontend\bin\Debug\net5.0\publish\
```

## Implementation notes
Where applicable, implementation notes can be found in README.md files in the directories for the respective C#/Blazor projects.
