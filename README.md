# PrimeView

This is a WebAssembly static in-browser web application to view benchmark reports generated in/for the [Primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes) project.

At the moment, the application loads benchmark reports in JSON format from the `data` directory on the webserver. It starts with loading `report1.json`, then loads `report2.json`, and so on, until it receives an HTTP error on the request for a `report<number>.json` file.

The supported JSON format is the one generated by the benchmark tool in the Primes repository, when the --json parameter is used, with one optional extension: in the metadata object, a string `"user"` property can be added to indicate the user who generated the report.

As the report reader back-end is isolated from the front-end (and added via dependency injection), it will be easy to replace it with a client for a (REST) API that publishes benchmark reports, once that's available.

## Building

The solution can be built by running the following command from the repository root directory, once [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) is installed:

```
dotnet publish
```

At the end of the build process, the location of the build output will be indicated in the following line:
```
Frontend -> <repo root>\src\Frontend\bin\Debug\net5.0\publish\
```
